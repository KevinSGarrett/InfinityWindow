QA checklist (windowed fs/read patch)
1) GET /projects/{id}/fs/read with no start/end -> full content unchanged.
2) GET with start_line=5&end_line=10 -> returns only those lines; 400 if start>end.
3) GET with start_line=0 -> expect 400 validation error.
4) Non-UTF8 file returns 400 as before.
5) Run python -m qa.run_smoke to ensure no regressions.
