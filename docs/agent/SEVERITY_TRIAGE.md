Follow the [`Severity & Triage Policy`](./TEST_POLICY.md#severity-triage-policy) section inside `docs/agent/TEST_POLICY.md` for all definitions (P0–P3) and completion rules.  

Update that canonical section if severity logic changes; this stub exists solely for navigation and metadata completeness.
