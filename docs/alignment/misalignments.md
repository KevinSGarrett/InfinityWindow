# Alignment Log — Misalignments

This file records every confirmed misalignment or gap between the updated project plans in `C:\InfinityWindow_Recovery\Updated_Project_Plans` and the current repository (`C:\InfinityWindow_Recovery`). Entries should be exhaustive, with clear remediation notes or owners.

## Index
- Last updated by Cursor on: 2025-12-08
- Coverage status: Phase 1 checklist captured; no misalignments logged yet; pending backend/frontend/doc review.

## How to use this file
- Capture the plan source (file/section), the observed repo state, and the mismatch.
- Add severity/impact if known; add proposed fix or link to issue.
- Update status when fixed and move the item to `correct-alignments.md` once verified.

## Phase 0 — Prep
- Tracking structure established; no misalignments logged yet.

## Phase 1 — Plans intake (pending detailed extraction)
- Misalignments will be recorded as soon as detailed plan deltas are extracted.

## Phase 2 — Identified misalignments (from Updated_Project_Plans vs current repo)
- (Use this file only for items that have been started/in progress/implemented but conflict with the plans.)
- No misalignments recorded under the new rule (plan items not yet started belong in `todo-alignment.md`; ambiguous items go to `unsure-alignments.md`).
